#summary TODO items for the EZT project

Basic changes:
 * update the header and stuff for current contact info
 * note the (new) official location,
 * to move all the docco from the docstring to the wiki

In the [http://www.viewvc.org/ ViewVC] repository, there are a number of local changes:
 * allow iterables instead of (just) sequences
 * integrating the callback stuff is gonna be tricky because gstein wants to ponder them
  * the {{{[CALLBACK ARG1 ARG2]}}} form is a generic function-callback mechanism that kind of goes against EZT's ideals
