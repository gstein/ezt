HISTORY

EZT was started as part of the edna project (http://edna.sf.net/) in
early 2001. However, it was also intended towards use within the
ViewVC project (http://viewvc.tigris.org/). The bulk of EZT development
occured as part of ViewVC during 2001 and 2002.

In 2003, EZT started to get used in additional places: SubWiki,
Subversion's build system, and some infrastructure pieces at the ASF.
Greg also had a little private project which used and further modified
EZT a little bit.

The EZT project was started in October 2003 to pull together all of
the various incarnations and derivative developments of EZT into a
single, canonical location. This project was moved to Google Code in
June 2008, where it now resides.
