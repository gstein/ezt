HISTORY

EZT was started as part of the edna project (http://edna.sf.net/) in
early 2001. However, it was also intended towards use within the
ViewCVS project (http://viewcvs.sf.net/). The bulk of EZT development
occured as part of ViewCVS during 2001 and 2002.

In 2003, EZT started to get used in additional places: SubWiki,
Subversion's build system, and some infrastructure pieces at the ASF.
Greg also had a little private project which used and further modified
EZT a little bit.

The EZT project was started in October 2003 to pull together all of
the various incarnations and derivative developments of EZT into a
single, canonical location.
